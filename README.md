# Unity Space Sim  

Unity Space Sim is an open-source framework designed to help game developers create large-scale space simulation games. Built with Unity, this work-in-progress project tackles challenges such as rendering vast environments, realistic lighting over astronomical distances, and achieving a true sense of scaleâ€”all while maintaining optimal performance.

This repository is a live, public project under active development, licensed under the MIT License. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## ðŸš€ Features  

### Core Features  
- **Massive Sense of Scale:** Clever techniques like distance-based object scaling, dynamic lighting updates, and camera layering simulate the vastness of space.  
- **6 Degrees of Freedom Movement:** Control a spaceship with roll, pitch, yaw, and translational movement along three axes.  
- **Realistic Space Travel:** Experience interplanetary warp at ~95% the speed of light, with time dilation and visual effects such as:
  - Lorentzian length contraction
  - Field-of-view narrowing
  - The blueshift of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) into the visible spectrum using ESA and GAIA color maps in real time.  
- **Thrust Vectoring Animations:** Adds realism to spacecraft control.  
- **Micrometeorite Particle Effects:** Visual cues provide feedback for movement in the vast emptiness of space.  

### Planned Features  
- Enhanced relativistic visual effects.  
- Detailed planetary systems, including moons and interplanetary travel.  
- Procedural LOD mesh generation for planetary landings.  
- Interstellar travel and related mechanics.  
- Querying **SIMBAD** and other **ADQL** databases over the internet to populate celestial objects at their current positions during startup.  

## ðŸŽ® Getting Started  

1. **Download the Repository:** Clone or download the repository to your local machine.  
2. **Open in Unity:** Open the project in Unity Editor (tested on Unity version XX.XX).  
3. **Run the Simulation:** Open the `MainScene` and hit the Play button.  
4. **Explore:** Control the spaceship with realistic 6DOF controls and warp between planetary systems!
